# Introduction
{: .no_toc }
Isalos Predictive Analytics Platform (in short Isalos) is a simple and user-friendly software application that allows data manipulation and model development by non-programmers, as coding skills are not necessary to use the platform. Isalos enables you to manipulate your data using the well-known spreadsheet environment. In the spreadsheets data are represented as tables of instances: in the columns the values of the different variables-features are included, and each row contains an instance-example which is characterized by the values of the different features. The core concept in the operation of Isalos is that each tab acts like a node, where data are imported and exported in a tabular format, following processing and transformation using specific functions.
