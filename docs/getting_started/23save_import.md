## Saving Projects/Models
At any point during your work, select `File` $$\rightarrow$$ `Save As` [1] from the menu to save the entire project, including all data, models, and configurations. This will save your project in Isalos’ native format for project files (.ekk file). 

Make sure to also click `File` $$\rightarrow$$ `Save` [2] or press `Ctrl` + `S` on your keyboard periodically to ensure you don't lose any progress. This will update the current project with the latest changes.
