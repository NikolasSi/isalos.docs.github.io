The installation path will default to the "Program Files" directory of your computer. It is advised to change your installation path to a user directory, especially in the case that you do not have administrative access permissions, which you will need for a successful installation. To change the installation path, click on the `Changeâ€¦` button[2], and navigate to your user directory [3] and [4].

Once you navigate to the directory of your choice, you must create a new folder where the Isalos package will be installed. The installer will not allow the installation in a non-empty directory. To create a new folder on the spot, click on the `New Folder` button[5].
