### Windows

</div>

#### Run the Installer
{: .no_toc }

After double clicking the installer, the installation wizard will pop up to guide you through the process of selecting your preferences for the installation of the program [1].

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/Getting started/windows1.svg" alt="step1" width="800" class="img-responsive">
</div>

The installation path will default to the "Program Files" directory of your computer. It is advised to change your installation path to a user directory, especially in the case that you do not have administrative access permissions, which you will need for a successful installation. To change the installation path, click on the `Change…` button[2], and navigate to your user directory [3] and [4].


<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/Getting started/windows2.svg" alt="step2" width="800" class="img-responsive">
</div>

Once you navigate to the directory of your choice, you must create a new folder where the Isalos package will be installed. The installer will not allow the installation in a non-empty directory. To create a new folder on the spot, click on the `New Folder` button[5].

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/Getting started/windows3.svg" alt="step3" width="400" class="img-responsive">
</div>

After creating a new folder [6], you could also rename it as desired [7] and click `OK` [8] and `Next` [9] after confirming the installation directory.


<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/Getting started/windows5.svg" alt="step5" width="400" class="img-responsive">
</div>

You also have the option to create a desktop shortcut for the Isalos application for ease of launch of the application. Check the checkbox [10] if you wish for a shortcut to be created, otherwise uncheck the checkbox and click `Next` [11].


<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/Getting started/windows6.svg" alt="step6" width="400" class="img-responsive">
</div>

Finally, Isalos is ready to be installed, by clicking the `Install` button [12], you may be prompted by User Access Control to allow the installation of the software, of which you can accept to go through with the installation. This completes the installation process on Windows. Click on the `Finish` button to close the installation wizard [13].

<!-- ### First Launch and License Activation-->
After the installation is complete, there are a couple more steps that are needed to get the Isalos Analytics Platform up and running.

#### Placing License in Installation Folder
{: .no_toc }
Before launching Isalos for the first time, you must place your valid license file in the installation directory. Depending on the location of your installation, you may need administrator access permissions to do so. Navigate to the installation directory of Isalos, and place your license file there [1]. Once you have done this, you can double click the Isalos executable [2] to launch the application successfully.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/Getting started/MacOS_1.svg" alt="step1" width="100" class="img-responsive">
</div>

#### Run the Installer
{: .no_toc }
After opening the disk image, a new Finder window will appear showing the Isalos application icon. Drag and drop the Isalos icon into your Applications folder. This installs the application on your system.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/Getting started/MacOS_2.jpg" alt="step2" width="400" class="img-responsive">
</div>

#### Placing License in Installation Folder
{: .no_toc }
Before launching Isalos for the first time, you must place your valid license file within the application's internal folder structure. This step is essential for the application to recognize your license.

Open the Applications folder. Right-click on the `Isalos.app` icon and select `Show Package Contents` [2]. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/Getting started/MacOS_3.svg" alt="step3" width="800" class="img-responsive">
</div>

Navigate to the `Contents/` folder [3] and place your valid license file inside this folder [4]. You may be prompted to authenticate with an administrator password to complete this step. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/Getting started/MacOS_4.svg" alt="step4" width="400" class="img-responsive">
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/Getting started/MacOS_5.svg" alt="step5" width="700" class="img-responsive">
</div>

_Note: Ensure the license file is named correctly and has not been modified. Improper placement or filename issues may prevent the app from detecting your license._

Once the license file is correctly placed, you can double-click the Isalos application [5] to launch it successfully.

### Linux

#### Downloading the Installer
{: .no_toc }
Choose the appropriate package for your system:
* Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, etc.) $$\rightarrow$$ Download the .deb package.
* RHEL-based systems (Fedora, CentOS, Oracle Linux, AlmaLinux, etc.) $$\rightarrow$$ Download the .rpm package.

#### Verifying Package Signatures
{: .no_toc }
Before installing, you can verify the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded package.

##### Debian-based Systems (.deb)
{: .no_toc }
Ensure gpg is installed before verifying the package:

```js
sudo apt install -y gnupg
```
Download the following files from the download page:
* Application package: isalos-{version}.deb 
* Signature file:  isalos-{version}.deb.sig 
* Public key: isalos.key

###### Import the Public Key
{: .no_toc }
To validate a build’s signature, you must first import and trust the Isalos’s public code-signing key.

* Import the public key:

```js
gpg --import isalos.key
```

* Trust the Key (Optional but recommended to avoid warnings during verification). To trust the public key, extract its fingerprint:

```js
gpg --fingerprint
```

Edit the key and set the appropriate trust level:

```js
gpg --edit-key <fingerprint> trust
```

After running the command, you’ll enter the interactive key editing mode. The prompt will ask you to choose a trust level. Select the trust level and press Enter to confirm. Finally exit the edit mode by typing quit and pressing Enter.

###### Verify the Signature
{: .no_toc }

Run the following gpg command to check the package signature:

```js
gpg --verify isalos-{version}.deb.sig isalos-{version}.deb
```

If the verification is successful, you should see a message like:

```js
gpg: Good signature from "NovaMSoft <projects@hermes.novamechanics.com>"
```

##### RHEL-based Systems (.rpm)
{: .no_toc }

Download the following files from the download page:
* Application package: isalos-{version}-{release}.x86_64.rpm
* Public key: isalos.key


###### Import the Public Key
{: .no_toc }
On RedHat-based Linux systems, validation is built into the rpm command, however you first need to import the public key into rpm.

Import it with the following command:

```js
rpm --import isalos.key
```

###### Verify the Signature
{: .no_toc }
Use the following command to verify the package signature:

```js
rpm --checksig isalos-{version}-{release}.x86_64.rpm
```

If the verification is successful, you should see a message like:

```js
isalos-{version}-{release}.x86_64.rpm: digests signatures OK
```

Another method to verify that the package signature exists or not is by running:

```js
rpm -qpi isalos-{version}-{release}.x86_64.rpm
```

The output should indicate a signature field with the signature present.
