# Probability Distribution Functions
{: .no_toc }
Isalos provides tools to explore probability distribution functions across a wide range of well-known distribution families, including options to customize parameters for each distribution. This flexibility allows users to model specific scenarios, analyse different shapes of distributions, and observe how changes in parameters affect the distribution's behaviour. Isalos also provides the ability to plot the probability mass function (PDF) or probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random variable of a known distribution for the parameters that the user has inputted.

A probability distribution is a mathematical description of the probabilities of events, which are subsets of the sample space‚Äîthe set of all possible outcomes of a random phenomenon. To define probability distributions, two primary functions are used: the probability mass function (PMF) or probability density function (PDF), and the cumulative distribution function (CDF). The choice between the PMF and PDF depends on whether the random variable has a discrete or continuous sample space.

The probability distribution of a discrete random variable is characterized by a probability mass function which is a function that returns the probability of the random variable taking each value separately. For example, for a random variable $X$ the PMF is given as below: 

<div id="eq. PMF-discrete"> 
$$
\begin{equation}
PMF_X(x) = P(X = x) {\qquad [1] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

For a continuous random variable, the probability distribution is defined by the probability density function (PDF). While the PDF does not give the probability that $X$ takes a specific value (since for a continuous variable $ùëÉ(ùëã=ùë•) = 0$), it provides a measure of relative likelihood. For a continuous random variable $ùëã$, the PDF is defined as:

<div id="eq. PDF">
$$
\begin{equation}
PDF_X(x) = \frac{P(x < X \leq x + \Delta)}{\Delta} {\qquad [2] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random variable, whether continuous or discrete, gives the probability that the variable takes a value less than or equal to a specified value. For both types of random variables, having either the PMF/PDF or the CDF is sufficient to describe the distribution, as they can be derived from one another as follows:

For a discrete random variable: 

<div id="eq. CDF-discrete">
$$
\begin{equation}
CDF_X(x) = P(X \leq x) = \sum_{y \leq x} PMF_X(y) {\qquad [3] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

<div id="eq. PMF-discrete">
$$
\begin{equation}
PMF_X(x) = CDF_X(x) - CDF_X(y) {\qquad [4] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

For a continuous random variable: 

<div id="eq. CDF-continuous">
$$
\begin{equation}
CDF_X(x) = P(X \leq x) = \int_{-\infty}^x PDF_X(y) \, dy. {\qquad [5] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

<div id="eq. PMF-continuous">
$$
\begin{equation}
PDF_X(x) = \frac{dCDF_X(x)}{dx}, \quad \text{if } CDF_X(x) \text{ is differentiable at } x {\qquad [6] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

Another useful function in probability and statistics is the inverse cumulative distribution function (ICDF), also known as the quantile function. The ICDF is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and returns the value of the random variable $ùëã$ at which the cumulative probability is equal to a specified probability $ùëù$. Formally, for a given probability $ùëù$ (where $0 \leq ùëù \leq 1$), the ICDF is defined as:

<div id="eq. ICDF">
$$
\begin{equation}
ICDF_X(p) = x \text{ such that } CDF_X(x) = p {\qquad [7] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

Distributions with particular properties or those frequently encountered in practical applications are often given specific names and are characterized by certain parameters. For example, the Normal distribution is defined by its mean ($Œº$) and standard deviation ($œÉ$), which determine the distribution‚Äôs center and spread, respectively. Similarly, the Binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, with parameters $ùëõ$ (number of trials) and $ùëù$ (probability of success on each trial).

These named distributions are often accompanied by closed-form expressions for their PMFs or PDFs, making them useful in both theoretical and applied statistics. They allow for easier calculations of probabilities and expectations and provide important approximations for complex distributions. Additionally, many of these distributions have well-known cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) and can be transformed or manipulated using their parameters to fit specific data types or research needs.

## Binomial Distribution 
The Binomial distribution is a statistical distribution that describes the number of successes ($k$) in a sequence of $n$ independent experiments, which are also called Bernoulli trials, each with a Boolean-valued outcome: success (with probability $p$) or failure (with probability $1-p$). Since the values of $k$ are non-negative integers, therefore the binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution and has the following PMF:

<div id="eq. binomial">
$$
\begin{equation}
f(k; n, p) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} {\qquad [8] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

Where $k$ is the number of successes, $k‚àà{0,1,2,3,‚Ä¶,n}$, $n$ is the number of trials, $n‚àà{1,2,3,‚Ä¶}$ and $p$ is the probability of success for each trial, $p‚àà[0,1]$.

Calculate the distribution functions for the binomial distribution by browsing through the ribbon: 

| Statistics $$\rightarrow$$ Probability Distribution Function |

And then choosing `Binomial Distribution`.

## Erlang Distribution Special Case of Gamma Distribution 

The Erlang Distribution is a special case of the Gamma distribution in which the shape of the distribution is discretized. It is a two-parameter family of continuous probability distributions with support $x‚àà[0,‚àû)$. There are two ways in which this distribution is described either by the ‚Äúshape‚Äù $k$ which is a positive integer and the ‚Äúrate‚Äù $Œª$ which is a positive real number or instead of using $Œª$, the reciprocal of the rate is sometimes used instead and is called ‚Äúscale‚Äù $Œ≤$. The Erlang distribution is the distribution of $k$ independent exponential variables with mean $1/Œª$ each. Therefore, if the shape parameter $k$ is 1 the Erlang distribution is the same as the Exponential distribution. The PDF for both parametrizations of the distribution is given as below:

<div id="eq. erlang1">
$$
\begin{equation}
f(x; k, \lambda) = \frac{\lambda^x x^{k-1} e^{-\lambda x}}{(k-1)!} {\qquad [9] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

Where $k$ is the ‚Äúshape‚Äù of the distribution, $k‚àà{1,2,3,‚Ä¶}$, $Œª$ is the ‚Äúrate‚Äù of the distribution $Œª‚àà(0,‚àû)$ and $x$ is the support $x‚àà[0,‚àû)$.

Or

<div id="eq. erlang2">
$$
\begin{equation}
f(x; k, \beta) = \frac{x^{k-1} e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}}}{\beta^k (k-1)!} {\qquad [10] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

Where $k$ is the ‚Äúshape‚Äù of the distribution, $k ‚àà{1,2,3,‚Ä¶}$, $Œ≤$ is the ‚Äúscale‚Äù of the distribution $Œ≤‚àà(0,‚àû)$ and $x$ is the support $x‚àà[0,‚àû)$.

## Exponential Distribution
The exponential distribution models the probability distribution of intervals between events in a Poisson point process, where events happen independently and continuously at a fixed average rate. It can also be seen as a special case of the Gamma distribution and is the continuous counterpart of the geometric distribution. Notably, the exponential distribution has a memoryless property‚Äîthe probability of an event occurring in a future interval does not depend on how much time has already passed, meaning past events have no effect on future probabilities. The PDF for the Exponential Distribution is given as below:

<div id="eq. exponential">
$$
\begin{equation}
f(x; \lambda) =
\begin{cases}
\lambda e^{-\lambda x}, & x \geq 0 \\
0, & x < 0
\end{cases} {\qquad [11] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

Where $Œª$ is the rate or inverse scale of the distribution, $Œª‚àà(0,‚àû)$ and $x$ is the support $x‚àà[0,‚àû)$.

## Gamma Distribution
The Gamma Distribution is a two-parameter family of continuous probability distributions with support $x‚àà[0,‚àû)$. There are two ways in which this distribution is described either by the ‚Äúshape‚Äù $k/Œ±$ which is a positive integer and the ‚Äúscale‚Äù $Œ∏$ which is a positive real number or instead of using $Œ∏$, an inverse scale parameter is used $Œ≤ = 1/Œ∏$, called ‚Äúrate‚Äù. The exponential distribution, Erlang distribution, and chi-squared distribution are special cases of the gamma distribution. The PDF for both parametrizations of the distribution is given as below:

<div id="eq. gamma">
$$
\begin{equation}
f(x; k, \theta) =
\frac{1}{\Gamma(k) \theta^k} x^{k-1} e^{-\frac{x}{\theta}} {\qquad [12] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

Where $k$ is the ‚Äúshape‚Äù of the distribution, $k‚àà(0,‚àû)$, $Œ∏$ is the ‚Äúscale‚Äù of the distribution $Œ∏‚àà(0,‚àû)$ and x is the support $x‚àà[0,‚àû)$.

Or

<div id="eq. weibull">
$$
\begin{equation}
f(x; \alpha, \beta) =
\frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha-1} e^{-\beta x} {\qquad [13] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

Where $Œ±$ is the ‚Äúshape‚Äù of the distribution, $Œ±‚àà(0,‚àû)$, $Œ≤$ is the ‚Äúrate‚Äù of the distribution $Œ≤‚àà(0,‚àû)$ and $x$ is the support $x‚àà[0,‚àû)$.

## Geometric Distribution
The Geometric distribution refers to one of two discrete probability distributions, each modeling different aspects of Bernoulli trials‚Äîexperiments with two outcomes, success or failure, repeated independently.

The probability distribution of the number $X$ of Bernoulli trials needed to get one success, supported on $N = {1,2,3,...}$ with the following PMF: 

<div id="eq. geometric1">
$$
\begin{equation}
f(k; p) = (1 - p)^{k-1} p {\qquad [14] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

Where $k$ is the number of trials, $k‚àà{1,2,3,‚Ä¶}$, and $p$ is the probability of success for each trial, $p‚àà[0,1]$.

The probability distribution of the number $Y = X ‚Äì 1$ of failures before the first success, supported on $N_0=0,1,2,3,‚Ä¶$ with the following PMF:

<div id="eq. geometric2">
$$
\begin{equation}
f(k; p) = (1 - p)^k p {\qquad [15] \qquad}
\end{equation}

Where $k$ is the number of failures, $k‚àà{0,1,2,3,‚Ä¶}$, and $p$ is the probability of success for each trial, $p‚àà[0,1]$.

These two distributions differ in interpretation: the first counts the total trials needed for the first success (often called the shifted geometric distribution), while the second counts only the failures prior to the first success. It‚Äôs essential to distinguish between them, as they reflect slightly different perspectives on the number of trials and failures leading to the first success in a series of Bernoulli trials.

Calculate the distribution functions for the Geometric distribution by browsing through the ribbon:

| Statistics $$\rightarrow$$ Probability Distribution Function |

And then choosing `Geometric Distribution`.

### Input

## Negative Binomial Distribution
The Negative binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of failures in a sequence of Bernoulli trials before a specified number of successes ($r$). The PMF of the Negative Binomial distribution is defined as follows:

## Uniform Distribution
The uniform distribution is a family of symmetric probability distributions which describe an experiment where there is an arbitrary outcome that lies between certain bounds. The bounds are defined by the parameters of the distribution, a and b, which are the lower and upper limits. The PDF of the Uniform Distribution is defined as follows:

<div id="eq. uniform">
$$
\begin{equation}
f(x; a, b) =
\begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{b-a}, & a \leq x \leq b, \\
0, & x < a \text{ or } x > b.
\end{cases} {\qquad [19] \qquad}
\end{equation}
