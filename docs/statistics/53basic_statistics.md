# Basic Statistics
{: .no_toc }
Basic statistics is a tool that includes fundamental techniques used to summarize and interpret a given dataset. It encompasses descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, which help characterize the central tendency and variability of data sets. It also includes confidence intervals, providing a range within which population parameters are likely to fall, and hypothesis testing, which allows analysts to make inferences or decisions based on sample data. Additionally, weighting cases can be applied to adjust for the relative importance of different data points. These tools are essential for understanding data behavior and supporting informed decision-making in research and analysis.

## Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics is a collection of analytical methods used to effectively summarize or describe a given dataset. These methods involve various measures, including measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median, and mode), as well as measures of variability (e.g., range, variance, and standard deviation). By employing descriptive statistics, one can quickly evaluate the distribution and patterns within a dataset without relying on additional assumptions. Descriptive statistics play a crucial role as they offer valuable insights about a dataset in a straightforward manner, without the necessity of graphical representation, which might not have been feasible when dealing with large datasets.<sup>[1](#references-descriptive-statistics)</sup>. 


The available statistical measures in Isalos, applicable to both the population and to a sample of the population, include: 

###### Minimum
{: .no_toc}
The minimum (min) is the smallest value in a dataset, defining the lower boundary of the data range. There is no distinction in calculation between a sample and a population for this measure.

###### Maximum
{: .no_toc}
The maximum (max) is the largest value in a dataset, defining the upper boundary of the data range. Like the minimum, the calculation does not vary between a sample and a population.

###### Range
{: .no_toc}
The range is a measure of the spread between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset, calculated as:

<div id="eq. range">
$$
\begin{equation}
R = x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{min}} {\qquad [1] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

This measure does not differ between population and sample data.

###### Size/Count
{: .no_toc}
The size or count is the total number of data points in the dataset, denoted as $n$. It is used as the denominator in many statistical formulas to calculate averages and variations. Both population and sample datasets use the same method for counting data points.

###### Sum
{: .no_toc}
The sum is the total of all numerical values in a dataset, calculated as: 

<div id="eq. sum">
$$
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} {\qquad [2] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

Here, $x_{i}$ represents each value in the dataset. The calculation is identical whether dealing with a sample or a population. 

###### Median
{: .no_toc}
The median is the middle value of a dataset when ordered. The method does not vary between sample and population datasets.

If $n$ is odd, the median is the middle number calculated at position $p$ (where $p = \frac{n + 1}{2}$):  

<div id="eq. median-odd">
$$
\begin{equation}
\tilde{x} = x_{p} {\qquad [3a] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

If $n$ is even, it is the average of the two middle numbers at positions $p$ and $p+1$ (where $p = \frac{n}{2}$): 

<div id="eq. median-even">
$$
\begin{equation}
\tilde{x} = \frac{x_{p} + x_{p+1}}{2} {\qquad [3b] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

###### Mode
{: .no_toc}
The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset may have one mode, multiple modes, or no mode if no number repeats more frequently than others. This calculation is consistent for both population and sample data.

###### Midrange
{: .no_toc}
The midrange (MR) is the average of the maximum and minimum values of the dataset, calculated as:

<div id="eq. midrange">
$$
\begin{equation}
MR = \frac{x_{\text{min}} + x_{\text{max}}}{2} {\qquad [4] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

This calculation is the same for both sample and population data.

###### Root Mean Square
{: .no_toc}
The root mean square (RMS) provides a measure of the magnitude of a set of numbers, typically used to calculate the standard deviation. It is calculated by taking the square root of the average of the squares of the numbers:

<div id="eq. RMS">
$$
\begin{equation}
RMS = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2}} {\qquad [5] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

This formula is consistent for both population and sample datasets.

###### Mean
{: .no_toc}
The mean, often referred to as the average, is a measure of central tendency that sums all the numerical values in a dataset and divides by the count of the values. The equation for calculating the mean is:

For populations: 
<div id="eq. mean-population">
$$
\begin{equation}
\mu = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} {\qquad [6a] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

For samples:
<div id="eq. mean-sample">
$$
\begin{equation}
\overline{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} {\qquad [6b] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

###### Mean Absolute Deviation
{: .no_toc}
The mean absolute deviation (MAD) is the average of absolute deviations from the mean, providing a measure of variability. 

For populations:
<div id="eq. mad-population">
$$
\begin{equation}
MAD = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_{i} - \mu| {\qquad [7a] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

For samples:
<div id="eq. mad-sample">
$$
\begin{equation}
MAD = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_{i} - \overline{x}| {\qquad [7b] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

###### Standard Deviation
{: .no_toc}
Standard deviation measures the spread of data around the mean. 

For populations:
<div id="eq. sd-population">
$$
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \mu)^{2}} {\qquad [8a] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

For samples:
<div id="eq. sd-sample">
$$
\begin{equation}
s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \overline{x})^{2}} {\qquad [8b] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

The difference lies in the denominator, where $n-1$ (Bessel’s correction) is used for samples to provide an unbiased estimator.

###### Variance
{: .no_toc}
Variance measures the average squared deviations from the mean.

For populations:
<div id="eq. sd-population">
$$
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \mu)^{2} {\qquad [9a] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

For samples:
<div id="eq. sd-sample">
$$
\begin{equation}
s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \overline{x})^{2} {\qquad [9b] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

The distinction is similar to that of standard deviation.

###### Quartiles
{: .no_toc}
Quartiles divide the data into four equal parts. $Q1$ is the median of the lower half, $Q2$ is the median of the dataset, and $Q3$ is the median of the upper half. The method for calculating quartiles is consistent across sample and population data.

###### Interquartile Range
{: .no_toc}
The interquartile Range (IQR) is the difference between the third and first quartiles ($Q3$ - $Q1$), measuring the middle 50% spread of the data. There is no variation in calculating IQR between samples and populations.

###### Outliers
{: .no_toc}
Outliers are data points significantly distant from other observations. They are typically identified using the IQR; values below $Q1 - 1.5 \times IQR$ or above $Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR$ are considered outliers. This identification method applies equally to sample and population data.

###### Sum of Squares
{: .no_toc}
The sum of squares (SS) is the sum of squared differences from the mean. 

For populations:
<div id="eq. ss-population">
$$
\begin{equation}
SS = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \mu)^{2} {\qquad [10a] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

For samples:
<div id="eq. ss-sample">
$$
\begin{equation}
SS = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \overline{x})^{2} {\qquad [10b] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

This foundational calculation underpins variance and standard deviation.

###### Standard Error of the Mean
{: .no_toc}
The standard error of the mean (SEM) measures the accuracy with which a sample represents a population. 

For populations:
<div id="eq. sem-population">
$$
\begin{equation}
SEM = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} {\qquad [11a] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

For samples:
<div id="eq. sem-sample">
$$
\begin{equation}
SEM = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} {\qquad [11b] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

###### Skewness
{: .no_toc}
Skewness ($\gamma_1$) is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. Positive skewness indicates a distribution with an asymmetric tail extending towards more positive values, and negative skewness indicates a tail that extends towards more negative values. 

For populations:
<div id="eq. gamma-population">
$$
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{1} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \mu)^{3}}{n\sigma^{3}} {\qquad [12a] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

For samples:
<div id="eq. gamma-sample">
$$
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{1} = \frac{n}{(n-1)(n-2)} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{x_{i} - \overline{x}}{s} \right)^{3} {\qquad [12b] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

###### Kurtosis
{: .no_toc}
Kurtosis ($\beta_2$) measures the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. High kurtosis in a data set is an indicator of substantial outliers. 

For populations:
<div id="eq. beta-population">
$$
\begin{equation}
\beta_{2} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \mu)^{4}}{n\sigma^{4}} {\qquad [13a] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

For samples:
<div id="eq. beta-sample">
$$
\begin{equation}
\beta_{2} = \frac{n(n+1)}{(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \overline{x})^{4}}{s^{4}} {\qquad [13b] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

###### Kurtosis Excess
{: .no_toc}
Excess kurtosis ($\alpha_4$) is calculated by subtracting 3 from the standard kurtosis measurement. This adjustment helps to compare the tails of the distribution to those of a normal distribution, which has a kurtosis of 3.

For populations:
<div id="eq. alpha-population">
$$
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{4} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \mu)^{4}}{n\sigma^{4}} - 3 {\qquad [14a] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

For samples:
<div id="eq. alpha-sample">
$$
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{4} = \frac{n(n+1)}{(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \overline{x})^{4}}{s^{4}} - \frac{3(n-1)^{2}}{(n-2)(n-3)} {\qquad [14b] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

###### Coefficient of Variation
{: .no_toc}
The coefficient of variation (CV) is a standardized measure of dispersion of a probability distribution or frequency distribution. 
  
For populations:
<div id="eq. cv-population">
$$
\begin{equation}
CV = \frac{\sigma}{\mu} {\qquad [15a] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

For samples:
<div id="eq. cv-sample">
$$
\begin{equation}
CV = \frac{s}{\overline{x}} {\qquad [15b] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>  

This measure is useful because it allows comparison between distributions with different units or means.

###### Relative Standard Deviation
{: .no_toc}
The relative standard deviation (RSD) is expressed as a percentage and describes the dispersion or variability relative to the mean of the data. 

For populations:
<div id="eq. rsd-population">
$$
\begin{equation}
RSD = \left[ \frac{100 \times \sigma}{\mu} \right]\% {\qquad [16a] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

For samples:
<div id="eq. rsd-sample">
$$
\begin{equation}
RSD = \left[ \frac{100 \times s}{\overline{x}} \right]\% {\qquad [16b] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div> 

###### Frequency
{: .no_toc}
Frequency ($f_1$) refers to the number of times a particular data point or value appears in a dataset. It is a simple yet fundamental measure used to describe the distribution of data values. The basic formula for frequency is: 

<div id="eq. f1-sample">
$$
\begin{equation}
f_{i} = \text{Number of occurrences of value } \times x_{i} {\qquad [17] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

where $f_{i}$ represents the frequency of the $i$-th value $x_{i}$.

## Confidence Intervals

A confidence interval (CI) is a statistical tool used to estimate the range within which a population parameter (like a mean or proportion) is likely to fall, based on information from sample data<sup>[1](#references-confidence)</sup>. This interval is constructed around the sample estimate and provides an indication of where the true parameter might be with a certain level of confidence, usually expressed as a percentage like 95% or 99%.<sup>[2](#references-confidence)</sup>


To calculate a confidence interval, you typically need the sample mean (which provides a central estimate), the standard deviation (which measures the spread of the data), and the sample size (the number of data points). For proportions, you use the sample proportion instead of the mean. The formula for a confidence interval generally involves the sample statistic plus or minus a margin of error ([Eq. 1](#eq. confidence1)), which is derived from the standard deviation and the sample size, adjusted by a factor from a statistical distribution (like the Z-score in large samples or the t-score in smaller samples)<sup>[1,2](#references-confidence)</sup>.

The confidence interval when considering sample data is calculated based on below formula:

<div id="eq. confidence1">
$$
\begin{equation}
CI = \left( \overline{x} \pm t_{\text{critical}} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right) {\qquad [1] \qquad}
\end{equation}   
$$
</div>

where <span>$$\begin{equation}
\overline{x}
\end{equation}$$</span> is the sample mean, $s$ is the standard deviation of the sample data, $n$ is the sample data size and <span>$$\begin{equation}t_{\text{critical}} \end{equation}$$</span> is derived from the t-distribution, which accounts for degrees of freedom (df) that depend on the sample size and is found using [Eq. 2](#eq. confidence2) when confidence level is for example 95%:

<div id="eq. confidence2">
$$
\begin{equation}
t_{\text{critical}} = t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}, df} {\qquad [2] \qquad}
\end{equation}   
$$
</div>

where <span>$$\begin{equation}df=n-1\end{equation}$$</span> and $\alpha$ is the significance level which is calculated as <span>$$\begin{equation}\alpha=1-\text{confidence level}\end{equation}$$</span>. The value <span>$$\begin{equation}\frac{\alpha}{2}\end{equation}$$</span> reflects the two-tailed nature of the typical confidence interval (e.g. for 95 % confidence interval, <span>$$\begin{equation}\alpha=0.05\end{equation}$$</span> and <span>$$\begin{equation}\frac{\alpha}{2}=0.025\end{equation}$$</span>).<sup>[2](#references-confidence)</sup>

The confidence interval when considering population data is calculated based on [Eq. 3](#eq. confidence3):

<div id="eq. confidence3">
$$
\begin{equation}
CI = \left( \mu \pm Z_{\text{critical}} \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right) {\qquad [3] \qquad}
\end{equation}   
$$
</div>

Where $μ$ is the population mean, $σ$ is the standard deviation of the population data, $n$ is the population size and <span>$$\begin{equation}Z_{\text{critical}}\end{equation}$$</span> is derived from the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution), which is symmetric and has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The <span>$$\begin{equation}Z_{\text{critical}}\end{equation}$$</span> value for a given confidence level  is: 


<div id="eq. confidence4">
$$
\begin{equation}
Z_{\text{critical}} = Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} {\qquad [4] \qquad}
\end{equation}   
$$
</div>

Where $$\frac{\alpha}{2}$$ again accounts for the two-tailed nature of the test or interval. For a 95 % confidence interval, you look up or calculate the Z-value that corresponds to 97.5 % of the distribution (since 2.5 % is in each tail).<sup>[2](#references-confidence)</sup>

The confidence interval when considering population proportion is calculated based on [Eq. 5](#eq. confidence5):

<div id="eq. confidence5">
$$
\begin{equation}
CI = \left( p \pm z_{\text{critical}} \times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \right) {\qquad [5] \qquad}
\end{equation}   
$$
</div>

where $p$ is the sample proportion and is calculated as <span>$$\begin{equation}p = \frac{X}{n}\end{equation}$$</span>: where X is the number of successes in the dataset and n is the total sample size.

Isalos offers three methods for calculating confidence intervals. The first method involves inputting raw (sample) data, assumed to be a representative sample. In this method, the mean can be automatically calculated, and the user has the option to manually input the standard deviation value or allow the software to calculate it automatically. This flexible approach allows for accurate estimation of confidence intervals based on the provided sample raw data. The second method requires the user to manually enter the mean value, standard deviation, and sample size. Additionally, the user must indicate whether the data represents a sample or population. The third method calculates confidence intervals based on proportions. Here, the user needs to specify the probability and sample size.

These different calculation options in Isalos provide flexibility and accommodate various scenarios for estimating confidence intervals with ease and accuracy. All the above three options allow the user to manually specify the confidence level.

### Raw Data

As previously mentioned, the confidence intervals can be calculated using input raw (sample) data. The mean is automatically calculated, and the user has the option to manually enter or automatically calculate the standard deviation of the sample data. Additionally, the user can specify the desired confidence level for the calculation of the confidence intervals.

Use the `Raw Data` function for calculating confidence intervals by browsing in the top ribbon: 

|Statistics $$\rightarrow$$ Basic Statistics $$\rightarrow$$ Confidence Intervals $$\rightarrow$$ Raw Data|

#### Input

### Population Proportion

This method illustrates how the confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the population proportion based on the sample data, factoring in the given level of confidence.

Use the `Population Proportion` function for calculating confidence intervals by browsing in the top ribbon:

|Statistics $$\rightarrow$$ Basic Statistics $$\rightarrow$$ Confidence Intervals $$\rightarrow$$ Population Proportion|

#### Input
{: .no_toc}

Ensure that the input datasheet contains only one column of data. The data should be of nominal type and are divided into distinct categories that are mutually exclusive. Examples of such categories include "yes" or "no" responses, "male" or "female" categories, "pass" or "fail" outcomes, etc. If integer values are used to represent these categories, such as 1 or 0, it is acceptable.

#### Configuration
{: .no_toc}

| **Confidence level** | Manually insert confidence level which may range from 0 to 100. |
| **Sample size (n)** | Insert the number of data points in the dataset. |
| **Possibility (p)** | Enter the value that represents the sample proportion. |

## Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to decide whether the sample data sufficiently supports a particular hypothesis about a population. It generally involves formulating two competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis ($H_a$), and then collecting data to assess the evidence. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) is the hypothesis that there is no effect or difference, and it assumes that any observed differences in the data are due to random chance. The alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$) is the hypothesis that challenges the null, proposing that there is a true effect or difference in the population.

---

The goal of hypothesis testing is to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. If the evidence is not strong enough, we fail to reject $H_0$, meaning the sample data does not provide enough proof against it.

The first step in hypothesis testing is to state the null and alternative hypotheses and then select a significance level ($a$) which represents the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, typically set at 0.05 (5%), meaning there’s a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (Type I error). Common values for $a$ are 0.05 (5%) and 0.01 (1%).

The next step involves choosing the test statistic. The test statistic depends on the nature of the data and the hypotheses being tested. Common test statistics include the Z-statistic (for large sample sizes or known population variance) and the t-statistic (for smaller sample sizes or unknown population variance).

For a Z-test: <!--(when population standard deviation $\sigma$ is known or large sample size):-->

<div id="eq. Z-test">
$$
\begin{equation}
Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} {\qquad [1] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

For a t-test: <!--(when population standard deviation is unknown, and sample size is small):-->

<div id="eq. t-test">
$$
\begin{equation}
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} {\qquad [2] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

Where $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $\sigma$ and $s$ are the population and sample standard deviation repsectively, $n$ is the sample size and $\mu_0$ is the assumed mean of the population under the null hypothesis.

After computing the test statistic, we follow up by either calculating the p-value or comparing the test statistic with a critical value. The p-value measures the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one computed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level ($a$), we reject $H_0$. In some cases, you compare the test statistic directly to a critical value derived from a statistical distribution ($Z$ or $t$). If the test statistic exceeds the critical value, reject $H_0$.

There are two main types of hypothesis tests:

* One-Tailed Test. This test assesses if the population parameter is either greater than or less than a specific value. For example: 

<div id="eq. one-tailed">
$$
\begin{equation}
H_0: \, \mu \leq \mu_0 \, \text{or} \, \mu \geq \mu_0 \, (\text{depending on the research question})
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
H_a: \, \mu > \mu_0 \, \text{or} \, \mu < \mu_0 \, (\text{depending on the research question}) {\qquad [3] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

* Two-Tailed Test. This test checks for any difference, whether positive or negative, from the hypothesized value. For example:

<div id="eq. two-tailed">
$$
\begin{equation}
H_0: \mu = \mu_0 \quad H_a: \mu \neq \mu_0 {\qquad [4] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

Isalos offers three methods for conducting hypothesis tests. The first method is called `Sample Size, Mean and Standard Deviation` and requires the user to input the sample size, the sample mean, select whether the standard deviation is known or calculated from the sample and give its value. The software then performs a Z-test if the population standard deviation is known or a t-test if it is unknown, based on the inputted hypotheses and significance level. The second method is called `One Sample T-test` and involves inputting raw (sample) data. In this method, the mean and the standard deviation are automatically calculated from the sample and then a t-test for the given hypotheses and significance level is performed. Finally, the last method is called `One Sample Z-test`,  and  also involves inputting raw (sample) data. Here, only the mean is automatically calculated from the sample, while the standard deviation is given from the user, and then a Z-test for the given hypotheses and significance level is performed. 

These different hypothesis testing options in Isalos offer flexibility and can accommodate a variety of testing scenarios with ease and precision. All three methods allow the user to manually specify the significance level, ensuring accurate testing for a wide range of hypotheses.

## Weight Cases
The term “weight cases” in statistics typically refers to the practice of assigning a weight to each case (or a data point) in a dataset to adjust for its importance or representativeness. In some data samples, certain groups may be over-represented or under-represented relative to their actual prevalence in the population data. Weights are used to correct these imbalances, ensuring that the results more accurately reflect the total population. Properly weighted data can provide more accurate and generalizable estimates that reflect the population from which the sample data was drawn. However, applying weights also typically increases the standard error of estimates, reflecting the added uncertainty from the weighting process<sup>[1](#references-weight-cases)</sup>. Weighting is particularly critical in complex survey designs and is widely implemented in fields ranging from public health to market research to correct for sampling and non-sampling errors<sup>[1](#references-weight-cases)</sup>.

Use the `Weight Cases` function by browsing in the top ribbon: 

|Statistics $$\rightarrow$$ Basic Statistics $$\rightarrow$$ Weight Cases|


#### Input 
{: .no_toc}

The input data required for weight cases calculation consists of integers or real values. It does not typically handle categorical or textual data directly without converting those into numerical values first, since the calculations require quantifiable inputs.

#### Configuration
{: .no_toc}

| **Include/exclude columns** | Select the columns manually from the available options within the dialog window to perform weight cases calculation: Use the buttons to move columns between the `Included Columns` and `Excluded Columns` list. Single-arrow buttons will move all selected columns and double-arrow buttons will move all columns. Columns with categorical features cannot be selected for weight cases calculation. |

#### Output
{: .no_toc}

The output displays the frequency and percentage distribution of values for each column in your input dataset. It lists distinct values in each column along with their count (instances) and proportion of the total (% instances), providing a concise summary of the data’s distribution across these variables.

#### Example
{: .no_toc}

###### Input
{: .no_toc}

In the left-hand spreadsheet, insert the data for each variable you plan to use for weight cases calculations. In this example, this includes entering the values for gender as integers, age and weight directly into their respective columns. Each row should represent a single data point, ensuring the dataset is structured correctly for further analysis and weight calculation.
