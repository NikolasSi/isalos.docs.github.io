# Statistics
{: .no_toc }
Modelsâ€™ validation is a critical step during model development to evaluate whether the generated predictions should be considered reliable or not. The `Statistics` menu holds several functions that permit to assess and measure the accuracy of the predictions (either classification or regression), and to define the applicability domain of the models. It also holds a variety of functions for hypothesis testing, experimental design, and calculation of data descriptive statistics.

<!--CSS utility classes come in handy when you want to override default styles to create additional whitespace (margins/padding), correct unexpected shifts in font size or weight, add color, or hide (or show) something at a specific screen size.
