# Analytics
{: .no_toc }
This menu is the core element of the Isalos platform. It contains the modelling functions for both classification and regression model development and allows their use in different workflow steps. You can develop a regression or classification model choosing from the menu `Analytics` $$\rightarrow$$ `Regression` or `Analytics` $$\rightarrow$$ `Classification` respectively, and you can test the performance of different modelling methods and select the one that best fits your data. 

<!--CSS utility classes come in handy when you want to override default styles to create additional whitespace (margins/padding), correct unexpected shifts in font size or weight, add color, or hide (or show) something at a specific screen size.
