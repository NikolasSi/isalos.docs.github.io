# Classification
{: .no_toc }
Classification is a typical supervised learning technique in predictive modeling that aims to categorize data into predefined classes. Classification analysis is used when the target is a categorical value, and algorithms are trained on labeled datasets to predict the category of unseen objects. There are two types of classification problems; Binary classification where the possible outcome can be one of two distinct classes, and Multiclass classification where the outcome can be one of several categories. <sup>[1](#references-classification)</sup>

## k Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) is a simple non-parametric algorithm that operates by identifying the data points from the training set that are most proximate to a new unseen input. This instance-based learning method calculates the Euclidean distance between instances considering all attribute values in order to determine the closeness between data points. The _k_ parameter denotes the number of nearest neighbors to consider for the prediction.<sup>[1,2](#references-classification)</sup> The prediction of a new instance is assigned based on the class label that is most frequently represented among the _k_ nearest neighbors using the inverted distance as the weighting factor. As calculations of Euclidean distances are performed, scaling of data is performed within the function.

Use the `k Nearest Neighbors` classification function by browsing in the top ribbon:

## Fully Connected Neural Network 

A type of feedforward artificial neural network consisting of multiple layers of neurons. It consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers and an outer layer, which are fully connected with each other. A variety of non-linear activation functions are typically used in the hidden layer, allowing the network to learn complex patterns in data. MLP uses a backpropagation algorithm to train the model and classify instances.<sup>[1,2](#references-classification)</sup>

<!--## SOM

Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) are a special type of single-layer neural network for unsupervised learning, used for dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data. A SOM operates by clustering data points using competitive learning instead of error-correction learning utilized in other neural networks. The space defined by the training instances is represented in a map (usually two-dimensional), where the topological features of the input space are preserved. The neurons in a SOM represent different clusters of the data, and their arrangement on the map reflects the similarity between data points. <sup>[3,4](#references-classification)</sup>

## Radial Basis Function Network

Radial basis function networks (RBF) network is an artificial neural network that employs RBF kernels as activation functions. The network consists of three layers: the input layer modeling a vector that passes data, the hidden layer that performs computations and the output layer designated for classification problems. The output layer of the neural network is a linear combination of the activation (output) from the hidden units.<sup>[5,6](#references-classification)</sup>

A Radial Basis Function is a real-valued function $φ(r)$ that is dependent only on the distance between a fixed input point ($r$) to the center ($c$) of each neuron as reference point [Eq. 1](#eq. rbf1).<sup>[3](#references-classification)</sup>

<div id="eq. rbf1">
$$
\begin{equation}
\varphi(r) = d(\|r - c\|) {\qquad [1] \qquad}
\end{equation}
$$
</div>

The radial basis function kernels available in Isalos include:

Gaussian:

<div id="eq. rbf2">
$$
\begin{equation}
\varphi(r) = e^{-(\varepsilon r)^{2}}\end{equation}  {\qquad [2] \qquad}
$$
</div>

Multiquadric:

<div id="eq. rbf3">
$$
\begin{equation}
\varphi(r) = \sqrt{1 + (\varepsilon r)^{2}}\end{equation}  {\qquad [3] \qquad}

<div id="eq. rbf4">
$$
\begin{equation}
\varphi(r) = \frac{1}{1 + (\varepsilon r)^{2}}\end{equation}  {\qquad [4] \qquad}
$$
</div>

Inverse Multiquadric:

<div id="eq. rbf5">
$$
\begin{equation}
\varphi(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (\varepsilon r)^{2}}}\end{equation}  {\qquad [5] \qquad}
$$
</div>

Polyharmonic spline:

<div id="eq. rbf6">
$$
\begin{equation}
\varphi(r) = 
\begin{cases}
r^{k}, \: k = 1, 3, 5, \ldots \\
r^{k} \ln(r), \: k = 2, 4, 6, \ldots
\end{cases}
\end{equation} {\qquad [6] \qquad}
$$
</div>

where $k$ is the order of the spline.

Thin Plate Spline:

<div id="eq. rbf7">
$$
\begin{equation}
\varphi(r) = r^{2} \ln(r)\end{equation}  {\qquad [7] \qquad}
$$
</div>

Bump Function:

<div id="eq. rbf8">
$$
\begin{equation}
\varphi(r) = 
\begin{cases}
\exp\left( -\frac{1}{1 - (\varepsilon r)^{2}} \right), \: \text{ if } r < \frac{1}{\varepsilon}, \\
0, \: \text{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
\end{equation}  {\qquad [8] \qquad}
$$
</div>

The library uses a class of ensemble machine learning algorithms constructed from decision tree models. Ensemble learning operates by combining different individual base learners to obtain a final prediction.<sup>[8](#references-classification)</sup> In an iterative process, trees are added to the ensemble so that the prediction error (loss) of previous models is reduced. In classification tasks, there are different loss functions available for binary and multiclass problems.<sup>[9](#references-classification)</sup>

## J48 Decision Tree

J48 is an open-source Java implementation of the C4.5 statistical classifier, which performs classification based on pruned or unpruned decision trees or rules generated from them. In this interpretation, the algorithm uses the normalized information gain as criterion to split the dataset into subsets and uses the most influential attribute to make the decision in each node. J48 uses the pruning technique, which refers to the removal of branches from a decision tree that have limited contribution to the predictive performance of the model.<sup>[1,10](#references-classification)</sup>

## Statistical fitting

### Generalized Linear Models
Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are a flexible class of regression and classification models that generalize ordinary linear regression to allow for response variables that have error distributions other than the normal distribution. GLMs are particularly useful when the response variable is categorical (e.g., binary outcomes) or count data, where assumptions of normality and constant variance are inappropriate.
A GLM consists of three components:
1. 	Random Component: The response variable $$y_i$$  is assumed to follow a distribution from the exponential family (e.g., Normal, Binomial, Poisson, Gamma).
1. 	Systematic Component: A linear predictor  $$\eta_i= x_i^T \beta$$, where $$x_i$$ is the vector of predictors for the i-th observation, and $$\beta$$ is the vector of coefficients.
1. 	Link Function: A smooth, monotonic function $$g(⋅)$$ that relates the mean  $$\mu_i= E[y_i]$$ of the response to the linear predictor via $$g(\mu_i )= \eta_i$$.

Unlike traditional linear regression, GLMs do not assume a linear relationship between the predictors and the response. Instead, the link function transforms the expected value of the response variable to a scale where it can be modeled as a linear combination of the predictors.
GLM parameters are estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The likelihood is constructed based on the assumed distribution of the response variable, and the log-likelihood function is maximized to obtain the parameter estimates.
Because log-likelihood is usually a nonlinear function of the parameters, iterative optimization method such as Newton-Raphson and Fisher Scoring are used to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of each model.
Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding, where each category is represented by a binary (0 or 1) dummy variable. The reference category for each categorical variable is the first observed category, and its corresponding dummy variable is omitted to avoid multicollinearity. This omission allows the reference category to be implicitly represented in the model intercept, providing a baseline for interpreting the effects of the other categories.

#### Binary Logistic
Binary Logistic Classification is a type of generalized linear model used when the dependent variable is binary, meaning it takes only two possible outcomes (e.g., success/failure, yes/no, 1/0). The response variable is assumed to follow a binomial distribution, where each observation represents a single Bernoulli trial.
Unlike linear regression, logistic regression uses the logit link function, defined as:
<div id="logit link function" style="text-align: center;">
    $$
    \begin{equation}
    g(\mu) = logit(\mu) = log(\frac{\mu}{1-\mu})
    \end{equation}
    $$
</div>

Where $$\mu$$ is the probability of the event occurring (i.e., the probability that the dependent variable equals 1). This transformation ensures that the predicted probabilities always fall within the [0,1] interval.
Binary logistic classification is widely used in fields such as medicine, social sciences, marketing, and machine learning, particularly when the goal is to model and predict a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables (either continuous or categorical).

| Analytics $$\rightarrow$$ Classification $$\rightarrow$$ Statistical fitting $$\rightarrow$$ Generalized Linear Models |

And then choosing “Binary Logistic” as the `Type`.

##### Input
{: .no_toc }
All variables must be specified in the datasheet. Numerical values are required for covariates, while factors may be either textual or numerical. The dependent variable must be binary, typically coded as 0 and 1, representing the two possible outcome categories. The design for Binary Logistic Classification requires at least two columns in the input sheet: one column for the binary dependent variable and at least one column for an independent variable (either a categorical factor or a numerical covariate). Each row corresponds to a single observation.

|**Max Iterations**| Defines the maximum number of iterations the model is allowed to perform during the estimation process. If the model fails to converge before reaching this number, the algorithm stops and returns the values of the last iteration.|
|**Maximum Step-Halving**| Controls how many times the algorithm is allowed to halve the step size during parameter updates when an iteration leads to worse model fit.|
|**Dependent Variable**| Select the column that corresponds to values of the dependent variable. |
|**Reference Category**| Specifies which category of the dependent variable should be used as the reference level when calculating parameter estimates.|
|**Parameter Estimation**| This option lets you choose how the model parameters will be estimated, Newton-Raphson, Fisher Scoring or Hybrid.|
|**Maximum Scoring Iterations**| The "Maximum Scoring Iterations" parameter is used when the hybrid estimation method is selected, instead of Newton-Raphson or Fisher scoring alone, and specifies the maximum number of iterations to be performed during the scoring phase.|
|**Minimum Change in Parameter Estimates**| Sets the tolerance level for convergence — the smallest change in parameter estimates between iterations required to continue optimization. If the change in all parameters is below this value, the algorithm assumes convergence has been reached.|
|**Scale Parameter Method**| Determines how the scale (error variance) parameter is estimated. Options include: Fixed value, Deviance, or Pearson Chi-square. |
|**Value**| Specifies the scale parameter value manually, only when Fixed value is selected in the Scale Parameter Method. |
|**Factors/Covariates/Excluded Columns**| Select manually the columns that correspond to factors and the columns that correspond to covariates through the dialog window: Use the buttons to move columns between the Factors and Covariates list and Excluded Columns list. Single-arrow buttons will move all selected columns and double-arrow buttons will move all columns. At least one covariate  or factor column should be specified.|
|**Custom/Include All Main Effects/Full Factorial**| These options refer to the terms that will be included in the model. The Custom option allows the user to input a formula defining the exact terms to be included. The Include All Main Effects option allows the analysis of a model that only includes all main effects and finally, the Full Factorial option includes both all main effects and all possible interaction terms to build a full model. Note that the Include All Main Effects and Full Factorial options do not allow the use of a formula.|
|**Formula**| Specify the model formula used for the analysis if the Custom option is selected. Include all variables listed under Factors or Covariates, separated by “+”. To include interaction terms, use the format VariableA:VariableB. If interaction terms are included, the dataset must contain all combinations of the levels of the involved categorical variables — i.e., the design must be fully crossed — to ensure the model can be properly estimated.|

##### Output
{: .no_toc }
The output of the binary logistic clasification procedure is organized into three main sections: the Predicted Values Table, the Goodness of Fit Statistics, and the Parameter Estimates Table. 
1. The Predicted Values Table contains the actual values of the dependent variable and the corresponding predicted values generated by the model for each observation.
1. The Goodness of Fit Table includes statistical measures that assess how well the model fits the data, such as Deviance, Log-Likelihood, AIC, BIC, and related metrics.
1. The Parameter Estimates Table displays the estimated coefficients for each variable in the model, along with standard errors, confidence intervals, test statistics, degrees of freedom, and p-values.

#### Probit 
Probit classification is a type of generalized linear model (GLM) used for modeling a binary outcome variable, like logistic regression. The key difference lies in the link function: while logistic classification uses the logit link, probit classification uses the probit link, which is the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF). Mathematically, this is expressed as:
<div id="probit link function" style="text-align: center;">
    $$
    \begin{equation}
    g(\mu) = \Phi^{-1} (\mu) = X \beta
    \end{equation}
    $$
</div>

Where $$\Phi^{-1}$$ is the probit link, and $$\mu$$ is the probability of success.
The underlying assumption is that there exists a latent (unobserved) continuous variable that follows a standard normal distribution, and the observed binary response is a result of whether this latent variable crosses a certain threshold.
Probit classification is often used when the assumption of a normal distribution for the underlying latent variable is justified or preferred, or when the differences in tail behavior between the logistic and normal distributions are relevant.

#### Complementary Log-Log 
Complementary log-log classification is a type of generalized linear model (GLM) used for modeling binary outcome data, where the dependent variable consists of two categories (e.g., success/failure, event/no event). Unlike the logit or probit link functions, the cloglog link is defined as: 
<div id="cloglog link function" style="text-align: center;">
    $$
    \begin{equation}
    g(\mu) = cloglog(\mu) = ln(-ln(1-\mu))
    \end{equation}
    $$
</div>
Where $$\mu$$ is the probability of the event occurring. This link function is asymmetric, making it particularly useful when the probability of the event is either very small or very large (i.e., skewed response probabilities). Complementary log-log classification is commonly applied in time-to-event analyses, extreme value modeling, and situations involving hazard functions, such as survival analysis or epidemiological studies, where the event of the interest becomes more likely over time or under certain conditions.

Categorical variables can be represented using either text labels or numerical codes.

#### Ordinal Logistic
Ordinal Logistic Classification is a type of generalized linear model (GLM) used when the dependent variable is ordinal-that is, it consists of categories with a natural order but unknown or unequal spacing (e.g., “low”, “medium”, “high”). The most common model used is the proportional odds model, which assumes that the relationship between the predictors and the cumulative probabilities of being at or below a given category is the same across all categories. The typical link function used is the logit link, applied to the cumulative probabilities, resulting in a model of the form:
<div id="ordinal logit link function" style="text-align: center;">
    $$
    \begin{equation}
    g(\mu) = logit(P(Y \leq j)) = a_j - x\beta
    \end{equation}
    $$
</div>
Where j indexes the thresholds between categories. Ordinal logistic Classification is widely used in fields such as social sciences, medicine, and market research, especially when modeling outcomes like satisfaction ratings, disease severity, or agreement levels. 

Use the Ordinal Logistic Classification method by browsing in the top ribbon:

| Analytics $$\rightarrow$$ Classification $$\rightarrow$$ Statistical fitting $$\rightarrow$$ Generalized Linear Models |

And then choosing "Ordinal Logistic" as the `Type`. 

##### Input
{: .no_toc }
All variables must be specified in the datasheet. The dependent variable must be ordinal and expressed using numerical codes only (e.g., 1, 2, 3), where higher values represent higher levels in the ordering. It should consist of three or more ordered categories and must not contain any missing values or codes outside the defined ordinal range. For logical and interpretable results, the values in the dependent variable column should reflect the correct ordinal ranking for each observation. Independent variables may be either numerical or categorical. Categorical predictors can be represented using either text labels or numerical codes, but each entry should clearly correspond to the level of the factor it represents. The input datasheet must include at least two columns: one for the numerically coded ordinal dependent variable, and one or more for the independent variables. Each row must represent a single observation. This model is particularly suited for estimating the likelihood of an observation falling into a higher or lower category along an ordered scale.

##### Output
{: .no_toc }
The output of the ordinal logistic Classification procedure is organized into three main sections: the Predicted Probabilities Table, the Goodness of Fit Statistics, and the Parameter Estimates Table. 
1. The Predicted Probabilities Table displays the actual observed values of the ordinal dependent variable in the first column, followed by the predicted probabilities of each observation belonging to each outcome category. These probabilities are based on the fitted model and indicate how likely each case is to fall into each level of the ordinal outcome.
1. The Goodness of Fit Table includes statistical measures that assess how well the model fits the data, such as Deviance, Log-Likelihood, AIC, BIC, and related metrics.
1. The Parameter Estimates Table displays the estimated coefficients for the model. The first rows refer to the thresholds (cut-points) between the ordinal categories of the dependent variable. These are followed by the coefficients for the independent variables, showing their effect on the likelihood of being in a higher category. The table also includes the standard errors, 95% confidence intervals, test statistics, degrees of freedom, and p-values used to assess the statistical significance of each term in the model.

#### Ordinal Probit
Ordinal Classification, as discussed earlier, is a type of generalized linear model (GLM) used when the dependent variable is ordinal—that is, it consists of categories with a natural order but unknown or unequal spacing (e.g., “low”, “medium”, “high”). A common variant of this model uses the probit link function, which, instead of the logistic function, applies to the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF) to model the cumulative probabilities. The model takes the following form:
<div id="ordinal probit link function" style="text-align: center;">
    $$
    \begin{equation}
    g(\mu) = probit(P(Y \leq j)) = a_j - x\beta
    \end{equation}
    $$
</div>
Where j indexes the thresholds between categories, xβ represents the linear predictor, and the probit function is the inverse of the standard normal CDF ($$\Phi^{-1}$$). The interpretation is broadly like that of the proportional odds model with the logit link, although the probit model assumes that the underlying latent errors follow a standard normal distribution, as opposed to the logistic distribution assumed in the logit case. The probit link is commonly used in fields such as psychometrics and economics, where the assumption of normally distributed errors may be more appropriate. It is also useful when comparing different GLM approaches or when theoretical considerations favor the normal distribution over the logistic.

##### Input
{: .no_toc }
All variables must be specified in the datasheet. The dependent variable must be ordinal and expressed using numerical codes only (e.g., 1, 2, 3), where higher values represent higher levels in the ordering. It should consist of three or more ordered categories and must not contain any missing values or codes outside the defined ordinal range. For logical and interpretable results, the values in the dependent variable column should reflect the correct ordinal ranking for each observation. Independent variables may be either numerical or categorical. Categorical predictors can be represented using either text labels or numerical codes, but each entry should clearly correspond to the level of the factor it represents. The input datasheet must include at least two columns: one for the numerically coded ordinal dependent variable, and one or more for the independent variables. Each row must represent a single observation. This model is particularly suited for estimating the likelihood of an observation falling into a higher or lower category along an ordered scale.

#### Multinomial Logistic 
Multinomial Logistic Classification is a classification method that generalizes logistic classification to multiclass problems, i.e. with more than two possible discrete outcomes that cannot be ordered.
This type of GLM assumes the response variable follows a multinomial distribution which is a generalization of the binomial distribution for more than two categories. 
The link function used is the SoftMax function which for a response variable Y with K possible classes is defined as:
<div id="multinomial non reference function" style="text-align: center;">
    $$
    \begin{equation}
    P(Y = k) = \frac{e^{\eta_k}}{1 + \sum_{j=1}^{K-1}e^{\eta_j}}, \text{ for (k = 1,.., K - 1)}
    \end{equation}
    $$
</div>
<div id="multinomial reference function" style="text-align: center;">
    $$
    \begin{equation}
    P(Y = k) = \frac{1}{1 + \sum_{j=1}^{K-1}e^{\eta_j}}, \text{ for the reference category}
    \end{equation}

### Generalized Estimating Equations
Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) extend Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to handle correlated or clustered response data, such as repeated measures or longitudinal observations. GEEs are particularly useful when responses are not independent, as they allow for within-subject correlation, making them ideal for analyzing data collected over time or across related units.
A GEE model consists of the following key components:
1.  Mean Structure: Like GLMs, the expected value of the response variable is modeled using a linear predictor :
<div id="linear predictor" style="text-align: center;">
    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \eta_i = x_i^T\beta
    \end{equation}
    $$
</div> 

Where $$x_i$$ is the vector of predictors and $$\beta$$ is the vector of coefficients.
1. 	Link Function: A monotonic function $$g(∙)$$ that links the mean of the response $$\mu_i= E[y_i]$$ to the linear predictor, so that $$g(\mu_i)=\eta_i$$.
1. Working Correlation Matrix: Specifies the assumed correlation structure among repeated observations within the same subject. Common structures include:
    1. Independent: assumes no within-subject correlation.
    1. Exchangeable: assumes equal correlation between all pairs of observations.
    1. AR(1): assumes correlations decrease with time distance.
    1. Unstructured: allows a distinct correlation for each pair of observations, with no constraints.
    1. M-dependent: assumes nonzero correlations only up to lag M, and zero correlations beyond that distance.

GEE estimation relies on solving quasi-likelihood equations rather than maximizing a full likelihood function, making it a semi-parametric approach. Parameters are estimated using iterative methods such as iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), and standard errors are typically computed using robust estimators to ensure valid inference even if the correlation structure is misspecified.
In GEE models, a subject variable is required to identify the unit over which repeated measurements occur (e.g., patient ID). Optionally, a within-subject variable (e.g., time or visit number) can be specified to define the ordering of repeated measurements. Cases are usually sorted by subject and within-subject variables to ensure correct modeling of correlation patterns.
The robust covariance estimator is the default choice, providing consistent standard errors under mild assumptions. The model-based estimator may be more efficient if the correlation structure is correctly specified, but it is more sensitive to misspecification.
Categorical variables are encoded using dummy coding, as in GLMs. The reference category is omitted by default to avoid multicollinearity and serve as a baseline for interpreting effects.

Each variant of this method is specified by the distribution of the response variable and the link function used. In the table below we specify the distribution and link function used for each variant:

|**GEE Variant**|**Distribution**|**Link Function**|
|Binary Logistic|Binomial|Logit|
|Probit|Binomial|Probit|
|Complementary Log-Log|Binomial|CLogLog|
|Ordinal Logistic|Multinomial|Logit|
|Ordinal Probit|Multinomial|Probit|

All variables must be specified in the datasheet. The dependent variable must be binary, as Binary Logistic Classification within the GEE framework models dichotomous outcomes.

The input datasheet must include at least two columns: one for the dependent variable and one or more for the independent variables (covariates or factors). Each row should correspond to a single observation. Additionally, a subject identifier column is required to define clusters of repeated measurements, and optionally a within-subject variable (e.g., time) to specify the order of observations within each subject.

And then choosing "Complementary Log-Log" as the `Type`.

##### Input
{: .no_toc }
All variables must be specified in the datasheet. The dependent variable must be a binary categorical variable, containing exactly two distinct outcomes (e.g., 0 and 1, or two unique labels). The dependent variable should not contain missing entries or values outside the two defined categories. Independent variables may be either numerical or categorical. Categorical variables can be represented using either text labels or numerical codes. The input datasheet must include at least two columns: one for the dependent variable and one or more for the independent variables. Each row should represent a single observation. This model is particularly useful when the probability of the event is highly skewed (close to 0 or 1) and is often applied in contexts involving time-to-event outcomes or hazard-based modeling.

## Tips

k Nearest Νeighbors:
*   It works more efficiently for small to medium datasets and low-dimensional data. kNN is sensitive to missing data.
*   The performance of the model is highly influenced by the selection of _k_.

<!--SOM: *-->

Radial Basis Function Network:
*   The number of neurons in the hidden layer has a high impact on the model performance, since a large number of neurons can lead to overfitting.

XGBoost:
*   Be cautious during hyperparameter tuning: Choosing smaller `eta` values, as well as increasing the `lambda`, `alpha` and `gamma` values result in a more conservative boosting process. Increasing the value of `max depth` parameter makes the model more complex, more likely to overfit.

Random Forest:
*   This algorithm performs well with datasets that contain missing values. However, it is not as efficient with a large number of sparse features or with categorical variables of many levels that are improperly encoded.
