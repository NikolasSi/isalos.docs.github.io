## Mixtures Design

Mixture design (experiment) is a special class of response surface method (RSM). These experiments focus on understanding how various proportions of components influence the overall characteristics of a mixture. A critical aspect of mixture experiments is that the factors being tested are the proportions of each component within the mixture. There's an inherent constraint in these experiments: the sum of the proportions of all components must always equal 1. This constraint introduces unique challenges in both the design and analysis phases of the experiments.

To effectively address these challenges, two popular designs are often employed: the simplex lattice design and the simplex centroid design. The simplex lattice design offers a comprehensive approach by testing at all possible combinations of component proportions, including those at the vertices, edges, and faces of the simplex. This design allows for a detailed exploration of the interactions between components across the entire range of possible formulations.

In contrast, the simplex centroid design focuses on the centroid of each subspace of the simplex, including the overall centroid. This method is particularly beneficial for initial studies where a full-scale experimental approach may be impractical. It provides a more streamlined set of experiments that can still yield valuable insights into the main effects and some interactions among the mixture components.

Both the simplex lattice and simplex centroid designs are instrumental in overcoming the challenges posed by the fixed sum constraint in mixture experiments. They enable researchers to systematically explore and optimize different formulations, making them invaluable tools in the development of new products and processes where mixture proportions are critical.

Use the `Mixtures` function by browsing in the top ribbon: 

|DOE $$\rightarrow$$ Mixtures $$\rightarrow$$ Mixtures Design|

### Input 
{: .no_toc}

Input data for Mixtures design is not required.

### Configuration 
{: .no_toc}

| **Number of Blocks** | Select manually the `Number of Blocks`. The lowest value that can get is 1. |
| **Random Standard order** | You can tick/select the box if randomness is required in the output list of experiments. |
| **Time-based RNG Seed** | If randomness is selected, then you have the option to also tick/select the box to set the random generated number seed based on time. |
| **RNG Seed** | Select manually the random generated number seed if required. |
| **Select Design** | Select Design offers two options either `Simplex Centroid` or `Simplex Lattice`. |
| **Number of components** | Select the `Number of components` (factors) from the drop-down list. |
| **Degree of Lattice** | If `Simplex Lattice` design is chosen, then select the `Degree of Lattice` from the drop-down list. |
| **Augment the Design with Axial Points** | Select/tick the box to Augment the Design with Axial Points if desired. |
| **Augment the Design with Center Points** | If `Simplex Lattice` design is chosen, then there is also the option to select/tick to Augment the Design with Center Points. |
| **Component** | Drag the horizontal value bars for each component to specify the min and max (composition) value for each component. |

### Output 
{: .no_toc}

A list of experiments (combinations) is generated in the output datasheet along with the Block number and the Standard order based on the Mixtures design method selected.
