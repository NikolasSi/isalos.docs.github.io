# Robust Parameter
{: .no_toc }

Robust parameter design (RPD) is a crucial technique within the broader context of response surface methods, aimed at optimizing process settings to achieve desirable outcomes under varying conditions. In robust parameter design, the primary objective is to find factor settings that not only produce a mean response within specified limits but also minimize the response variability due to noise factors. Noise factors are variables that cannot be controlled during normal operation but significantly affect the process outcome. By controlling these noise factors during a process robustness study, it becomes possible to understand how fluctuations in these factors influence the response under different settings of the controllable factors.

The methodology typically involves fitting a second-order model for the controllable factors to capture the curvature of the response surface accurately. Additionally, the first-order effects and interactions of noise factors with controllable factors are modelled. These interactions are crucial as they help in understanding how changes in controllable factors can mitigate the effect of noise, thereby making the process more robust.

From the robust parameter design, two new models are developed. One model predicts the mean of the response as a function of the controllable factors, while the other predicts the variance. Notably, noise factors do not explicitly appear in these models; however, the parameter estimates for the interactions between control and noise factors critically influence the shape of the response surface for variance.

The Taguchi method is a well-known approach within robust parameter design, popularized for its structured way of studying the effects of multiple noise factors. Taguchi's key contribution is the use of orthogonal arrays to systematically analyze the effects of noise and control factors, reducing the number of experiments needed to gather sufficient data. This method places a strong emphasis on cost-effectiveness and efficiency in experimental design.

Combined array designs, often associated with Taguchi methods, involve the simultaneous consideration of both control and noise factors in a single experimental setup. This approach enables the experimenter to assess the interaction effects directly and is particularly useful in complex processes where interactions between control and noise factors are significant.

Both Taguchi methods and combined designs underscore the philosophy of robust design: optimizing product performance and quality under a range of operating conditions by systematically controlling and examining variability. These methodologies are integral to developing products and processes that are consistently reliable and meet customer expectations in the real world.

## Input
{: .no_toc}

Numerical values should be specified in the input datasheet. Minimum of three columns (factors) should be specified as the minimum requirement for performing Robust Parameter design calculation is to have at least two control factors and one noise factor. Two levels/values should be specified for each factor (column) as minimum requirement.

## Configuration
{: .no_toc}

|**Number of Blocks**| Select manually the Number of Blocks. The lowest value that can get is 1.|
|**Random Standard order**|You can tick/select the box if randomness is required in the output list of experiments.|
|**Time-based RNG Seed**|If in the randomness is selected, then you have the option to also tick/select the box to set the random generated number seed based on time.|
|**RNG Seed**|Select manually the random generated number seed if required.|
|**Taguchi Design**|Select/tick the radio button corresponding to Taguchi Design if required.|
|**Combined Design**|Select/tick the radio button corresponding to Combined Design if required.|
