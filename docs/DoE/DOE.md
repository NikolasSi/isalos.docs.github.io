# Design of Experiments
{: .no_toc }
Design of Experiments (DoE) is a systematic approach to planning, conducting, and analyzing controlled tests to understand the factors that influence a particular outcome. It involves manipulating one or more independent variables to observe their effects on a dependent variable, allowing researchers to determine cause-and-effect relationships and optimize processes. By using techniques such as randomization, replication, and blocking, DoE enhances the reliability and validity of experimental results, making it a crucial tool in scientific research and industrial applications.
