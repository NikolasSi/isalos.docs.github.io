# Screening
{: .no_toc }
Screening Designs are a subcategory under Design of Experiments (DoE),  focused on identifying the most significant factors that influence a response variable before optimizing. These designs are used when there are many potential factors to consider, and the goal is to quickly determine which ones have a meaningful effect in order to preserve resources and minimize cost. By systematically varying multiple factors at different levels and analyzing their effects, screening designs help prioritize the factors that warrant further investigation in more detailed studies.

## Plackett Burman
Plackett-Burman designs are an efficient and economical approach within the DoE framework, particularly tailored for screening large numbers of factors in a system, similar to the Fractional Factorial Design. These designs are used to explore the main effects of up to $ùëò = ùëÅ ‚àí 1$ factors in $ùëÅ$ experimental runs, where $ùëÅ$ is a multiple of 4 (e.g., 8, 12, 16). Moreover, all factors should have exactly two levels which we call high(+) and low (-). This structure allows researchers to identify which factors have significant main effects while minimizing the number of experimental runs required. This method becomes invaluable in scenarios where a full factorial design would necessitate prohibitively large experiments, consuming excessive time and resources.

Plackett-Burman designs achieve their efficiency by maximizing the number of factors that can be evaluated in a minimal number of runs. Unlike fractional factorial designs, which are crafted to manage both main effects and interactions, Plackett-Burman designs are specifically focused on detecting main effects. They are classified as resolution III designs, meaning that while they are well-suited to identify main effects, they confound these main effects with two-factor interactions. This confounding is a calculated trade-off, as the design assumes that two-factor interactions are either negligible or of less interest in the preliminary stages of experimentation.

For instance, in a Plackett-Burman design with 12 runs, up to 11 factors can be investigated, and any two-factor interactions will be indistinguishable from the main effects. This arrangement is particularly useful when the goal is rapid screening to pinpoint which factors have the most influence on the response variable, rather than an exhaustive analysis of all interactions. When the number of runs is a power of two (e.g., 8 or 16), the Plackett-Burman design is identical to a resolution III fractional factorial design.

Plackett-Burman designs are exceptionally valuable in early-stage experiments where a large number of factors are present, but only a subset is likely to have a substantial impact on the outcome. In these situations, they provide a powerful means to filter out the less impactful factors, allowing researchers to focus subsequent experiments on the most promising candidates. By reducing the number of necessary experiments, Plackett-Burman designs offer a practical balance between resource efficiency and the acquisition of critical data, making them an indispensable tool in experimental research for system optimization and improvement.

## Fractional Factorial

Fractional factorial designs represent a refined approach within the framework of DoE that addresses the challenge of studying systems with multiple factors without resorting to the exhaustive method used in full factorial designs. By selectively sampling a fraction of the full factorial design, these designs allow researchers to explore the effects of various factors using a substantially reduced number of experimental runs. This method is particularly valuable when dealing with a large number of factors, where a full factorial design would require an impractically large set of experiments, escalating costs and resource usage.

The efficiency of fractional factorial designs comes from their strategic choice of factor level combinations, capturing essential information about the system while significantly cutting down on the number of required experiments. This efficiency, however, introduces the primary challenge of confounding. Confounding occurs when the effects of some factor combinations become indistinguishable from others. For instance, in a four-factor experimental setup, a typical confounding pattern such as ‚ÄúA - B - C - BC‚Äù implies that the effect of the fourth factor is entangled with the combined effects of the second and third factors. This overlap means that while the design is more efficient, it sacrifices some ability to precisely attribute effects to individual factors or their specific combinations.

Despite this trade-off, with meticulous design and a clear understanding of the system under study, fractional factorial designs can yield significant insights. They are particularly adept at identifying the main effects and certain interactions among the factors, which are often sufficient for preliminary analysis or when certain factors or interactions are suspected to be of lesser importance.

Moreover, fractional factorial designs prove exceptionally useful in scenarios where some factors are presumed to have minimal or no effect, or where certain interactions are deemed negligible. In these cases, the designs can provide nearly as comprehensive information as full factorial designs but at a fraction of the operational cost and effort. This makes fractional factorial designs a highly strategic tool in experimental research, balancing resource management with the acquisition of critical data points necessary for effective decision-making in system optimization and improvement.

Isalos uses a term called ‚ÄúFraction Relationship‚Äù to determine the confounding pattern the user wishes to use. The ‚ÄúFraction Relationship‚Äù is a sequence of strings, separated by spaces, where the $k^{th}$ string specifies how  the $k^{th}$  factor is confounded. If a factor is not confounded with any other, it is represented by its corresponding single letter. For example, when conducting an experiment with 5 factors which we denote A, B, C, D and E, a valid ‚ÄúFraction Relationship‚Äù would be ‚ÄúA B C AB AC‚Äù which determines that D = AB and E=AC.

Resolution measures the extent to which effects‚Äîsuch as main effects and interactions between factors‚Äîcan be uniquely estimated without confounding. It is determined by the shortest word in the defining relation of the design, which represents the smallest group of factors whose effects are confounded. The minimum acceptable resolution for a design is Resolution III, as resolutions below this result in main effects being confounded with one another, which is undesirable for meaningful analysis.

To assist users in determining the required "Fraction Relationship," the software provides a comprehensive list of available designs that deliver maximum resolution for each case. These designs serve as a reliable reference, derived from authoritative sources <sup>[3, 4, 5](#references-design-of-experiments)</sup>.
