Scatter charts plot individual data points on the horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) axes to observe relationships between variables. Line charts connect data points with lines to show trends over intervals. Bar charts are useful for visually comparing different categories of data and seeing which category has the highest or lowest value.

Use the `Scatter/Line Chart` function by browsing in the top ribbon:
